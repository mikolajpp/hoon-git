::    
::  A bytestream is a triple of a cursor, an offset, and octs data.
::  The offset cursor points at the next byte to be read or written.
::  
::  There are three families of functions: for reading, 
::  writing and appending to a bytestream. they operate 
::  upon three kinds of data: a singular byte, a sequence of 
::  bytes (octs), or a text (cord).
::
::  A combined operation of reading from a source bytestream
::  and writing the resulting data to a target bytestream is called
::  a 'write-read'. 
::
::  A write or append to a bytestream always succeeds. 
::  A read can fail if the source bytestream is exhausted:
::  reading arms either crash on failure, or return a unit (maybe).
::
::  Each read advances the cursor by a corresponding
::  number of bytes read; peek functions do not advance the stream.
::
::  Each write advances the cursor by a corresponding
::  number of bytes written; append functions do not advance the stream.
